# MySQL Directory Tree

Once I got test task at interview  where I was required to create a webapp (using Python and MySQL) 
which would represent directory structure with possibility to add and remove directories and to 
show and hide their structure. Another requirement was to use only raw SQL, without any ORMs.

I didn't make it at the time, but after I got some experience I decided to 
make at least prototype of the app, so here it is. It uses D3.js for rendering directory structure and
Flask with Flask-RESTful for backend.

Please note that MySQL in general doesn't work really well with tree-like structures, here I used so-called
[Nested Set Model](http://mikehillyer.com/articles/managing-hierarchical-data-in-mysql/) for implementing it, 
but, again, in general you will need something more suitable than relational model databases.  

## Installation

You have to have mysql server installed and running at localhost.

```
git clone https://github.com/thefivekey/mysqldirectorytree.git
cd mysqldirectorytree
pip install -r requirements.txt
mysql -h localhost -u <username> -p < dbgen.sql 

```

## Usage

```
python dbtree.py <your mysql username> <your mysql password>
```
will run Flask development server ( You may change it to Gunicorn, if you like, but in this case it doesn't matter much).

Open your browser at 127.0.0.1:5000 and feel free to add some folders or remove them. Sadly, it doesn't always work as intended, sometime 
I might fix it and complete the taskâ€¦

I highly recommend to use [virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) and run all the above in dedicated environment.
